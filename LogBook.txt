_Began working in the assingment.
_When mixing Led display and voice input the Leds seem to lose their "While button is pressed" functionality,
 they only trigger with each key press instead.
_Began testing with the FFT, not working so far.

_Efforts focus on getting the FFT to work as is the a step require to extract the Pitch.

_Due to the large amount of linker errors I have decided to start over again. This time I 
will use the example provided in my StudySpace by the name of "AudioAjuster"
_The negative part of the complex FFT is reducing the working frequencies to a half the original bandwidth.
However the template project has a function that allows us to filter its
_For further testing I will be using an Android Appliction which allows to output a pure frequency tone

_During testings seems I didn´t do the frequency range limitation as it needed. The present version is trying to create an interval 
of 128 (corresponds to 7 bits) from the range 0 to 8000 Hz. Since we have filtered the negative Complex frequency representation we 
should be working from 0 to 4000 Hz instead.  

_A working version has been developed. Each of the three LEDs represent a different range of frequencies. Red represent low frequencies, from 0 to 1333 Hz. 
Yellow for mid-frequencies (1333 tp 2666). Red for high Frequencies (2666 and higher).

_This version has a small flickr at any of the states. So far I have not been able to determine the nature of this problem.
There is a chance that the input introduces a little noise and this may cause that the other lights briefly activate for an instance.
However it can be appreciated that the light that was supposed to be active brights for most of the time.
Another possibility could be that the code contains a bug that causes the flickering lights.

_The code has been reorganized and revisited, but the flickering problem remains. The code could still be incorrectly implemented and there will be further 
revisions in the future.
